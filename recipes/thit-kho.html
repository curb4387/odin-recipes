        <h2>Pork and eggs all in one pot, boiled to sweet and salty perfection.</h2>
        <p>I actually don't remember how to make this.</p>
        <p>I literally called my grandma to ask her the other month.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork shoulder</li>
            <li>Boiled eggs</li>
            <li>Shallots</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Coconut water</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Something about cutting your pork up and letting it dry for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mince shallots and garlic. Use half of this to mix into the raw pork.</li>
            <li>I think you gotta put the stove on medium-low.</li>
            <li>Add oil to a pot. Add garlic and shallots and cook until aromatic.</li>
            <li>Add in sugar and mix with garlic and shallots.</li>
            <li>Once golden or browned, add in coconut water.</li>
            <li>Let it boil and then add in pork.</li>
            <li>Once the pork is thoroughly cooked, add in your boiled eggs.</li>
            <li>Let that simmer for a while, removing any foam from the top of the liquid.</li>
            <li>Serve over white rice!</li>
        </ol>
