            <p>Behold! Vietnamese recipes that I may or may not know how to actually make!</p>
            <p>
                Don't worry. I learned and wrote down all of this from my grandma. So you know it's at least a bit accurate.
                When I moved out for the first time (technically), I always found myself craving Vietnamese food like I always had back home.
                Who knew I had it so easy! Well, each time I had a craving, I would call my grandma and ask for the recipe. She would tell me
                the ingredients I needed and the step by step process. The hard part was figuring out what she meant by these measurements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other hard part was actually doing the cooking myself! Again, who knew I had it so easy back home!
                Cooking, especially as someone who isn't that familiar with the prep work, can be a long process.
                But it sure does produce some yummy stuff!
            </p>
            <p>I hope my grandma's Vietnamese recipes makes you feel right at home!</p>
