This repository contains two separate tries of the same project: Odin Recipes.

The first (2023-recipes) was finished in October 2023 when I was first studying web development with the Odin Project.

You can find this in the "old" branch.

The second (2024-recipes) was finished in May 2024 when I continued re-studying web development with the Odin Project. It was updated October 2025. This aims to put into practice all that was learned about the Box Model.

You can find this in the "main" branch.

Before starting on the second one, I reviewed my work in the first one and was surprised at how messy the code was. I sought to make an even better project to show myself how much I improved since the first project. The second project is much more ambitious with better designs using the box model.

There is more I have been learning now that I am pursuing a degree. I plan to redesign this project a third time to showcase what I have learned.
