This repository contains two separate tries of the same project: Odin Recipes.

The first (2023-recipes) was finished in October 2023 when I was first studying web development with the Odin Project.

The second (2024-recipes) was finished in May 2024 when I continued re-studying web development with the Odin Project.

Before starting on the second one, I reviewed my work in the first one and was surprised at how messy the code was. I sought to make an even better project to show myself how much I improved since the first project. The second project is much more ambitious with better designs using the box model.

There is more I have been learning now that I am pursuing a degree. I plan to redesign this project a third time to showcase what I have learned.
