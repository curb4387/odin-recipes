Odin HTML Project: Recipes
This is my first HTML project through the Odin Project, called Project: Recipes.

Once completing this project, I hope to demonstrate the skills I have learned with HTML, and ready myself for future styling with CSS.

* This includes setting up HTML boilerplates, head and body elements, headers, paragraphs, strong and emphasis, unordered and ordered lists, and more. Also, familiarize myself with Git workflow, good commit messages, and knowing when to commit.

*Finished October 2023*
